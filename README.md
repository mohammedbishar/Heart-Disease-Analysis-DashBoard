🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes heart disease patient data to uncover patterns, correlations, and risk factors. Using Power BI for visualization and Excel dataset for preprocessing, the dashboard provides a comprehensive descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis of heart disease.

The goal is to support healthcare decision-making by identifying factors contributing to heart disease and suggesting preventive actions.

📊 Dataset

File: Heart_Disease_Dataset.xlsx

Contains patient health records with attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Fasting Blood Sugar

ECG Results

Max Heart Rate

Exercise Induced Angina

Oldpeak (ST Depression)

Slope, Ca, Thal

Target (Heart Disease: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Size: ~300 rows × 14 columns

📈 Dashboard (Power BI)

File: Heart Disease Analysis.pbix

The dashboard covers four types of analytics:

🔹 Descriptive Analysis – What happened?

Distribution of patients with and without heart disease

Age & gender distribution

Key health indicators summary

🔹 Diagnostic Analysis – Why did it happen?

Correlation between cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart disease

Influence of age, chest pain type, and ECG results

Comparison between high-risk vs. low-risk patients

🔹 Predictive Analysis – What will happen?

Identifies patients with high probability of heart disease based on health indicators

Trend analysis for future risk groups

🔹 Prescriptive Analysis – What actions can be taken?

Lifestyle improvement recommendations

Indicators to monitor for early detection

Preventive healthcare actions for high-risk patients

🚀 Features

Interactive filters (age, gender, chest pain type, etc.)

KPI cards showing key metrics

Correlation visuals between multiple health attributes

Patient risk segmentation
